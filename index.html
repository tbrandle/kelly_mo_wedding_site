			<p>Ceremony and Reception- August 25, 2018 at Perry Mansfield, Steamboat CO Perry Mansfield quickly captured
			our hearts. With not one but two stunning aspen groves, rustic cabins, sprawling meadows and the privacy of having the entire
			property to ourselves, Perry Mansfield is perfect for our mountain souls. We love this unique location and can’t think of
			a better place to exchange vows than in the middle of a golden aspen grove and dance the night away in the picturesque pavilion.
